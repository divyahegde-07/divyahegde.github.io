# About me
Hi, Iâ€™m Divya, a data scientist who sees myself as a problem-solver first. Whether itâ€™s cleaning messy logs, architecting AI systems, or figuring out how to make a process run smoother, I get excited about building solutions that actually stick.

Before pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at Northeastern University, I worked as a Software Engineer at Salesforce, where I built scalable systems and learned the importance of designing with product goals in mind. During my co-op at the Burnes Center for Social Change, I partnered with the Massachusetts procurement agency to develop AI-powered tools that streamlined contract review and improved transparency. That experience strengthened my ability to translate stakeholder needs into technical requirements and explain complex NLP and language model concepts to non-technical audiences, ensuring alignment and real-world impact.

As a data scientist, I focus on bridging research and application. I bring a strong foundation in NLP, language models, and machine learning, along with hands-on experience deploying AI systems into production. Proficient in Python, AWS, API integrations, and MLOps, Iâ€™ve worked on projects that balance feasibility with innovation, always with the goal of creating AI solutions that are practical, impactful, and human-centered.

When Iâ€™m not deep in code or tinkering with new tools, youâ€™ll probably find me surrounded by my plants or chasing mountain trails for great views. To me, both solutioning and hiking require the same things: curiosity, persistence, and a love for the climb.
