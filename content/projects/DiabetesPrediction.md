Visualized the relationship between a person's lifestyle and the likelihood of developing diabetes. By analyzing lifestyle factors such as smoking habits, physical activity, fruit consumption, use of health trackers, and income levels, this dataset aims to predict whether these lifestyle choices impact a person's risk of diabetes. The goal is to identify the key lifestyle indicators that influence diabetes risk, which could assist healthcare providers in early intervention efforts to prevent diabetes onset.
